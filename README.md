## Hand Tracking Volume Contol Using OpenCv

In this computer vision project, I used hand tracking to implement Gesture Control for changing the volume of a computer, utilizing OpenCV's hand landmark detection algorithm. By tracking the landmarks of the hand, specific gestures were identified that could be used to control the volume of the computer. These gestures were mapped to corresponding actions, such as increasing or decreasing the volume, and were executed automatically when recognized by the program. The result is an intuitive and hands-free method of controlling computer volume that can be useful for individuals who have difficulty using traditional controls.
